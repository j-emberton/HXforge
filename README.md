# HXForge

**HXForge** is a work-in-progress open-source toolkit for the preliminary **design**, **analysis**, and **optimisation** of heat exchangers.

Built with **Rust** for performance and **Python Dash** for interactivity, HXForge aspires to become a fully featured, open-source environment for exploring and prototyping heat exchanger configurations — combining fast numerical models with an intuitive web interface.

## 🚧 Status

This project is in early development. Functionality is limited, and interfaces may change rapidly. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome as the framework evolves.

## 🔍 Goals

- Preliminary design tools for common heat exchanger types (e.g., shell-and-tube, plate, compact)
- Flexible boundary condition setup and configuration
- Multiphase flows
- Fast simulation engine (Rust backend)
- Interactive, browser-based interface (Dash frontend)
- Multi-objective optimisation tools (efficiency, pressure drop, cost)

## 📦 Tech Stack

- 🦀 Rust — performance-critical computations
- 🐍 Python — interface logic and orchestration
- 📊 Dash — interactive web UI
